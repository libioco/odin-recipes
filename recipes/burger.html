        <p>
            After a trip to Japan, the first meal I ate when I got back to the States was this very
            smashburger. Oh how I missed a good American burger.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground Chuck (80% lean)</li>
            <li>Potato Rolls</li>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>American Cheese</li>
            <li>Yum Yum Sauce</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast your buns. (Don't forget to butter them!)</li>
            <li>Roll the ground chuck into small balls but don't season them yet.</li>
            <li>
                Prepare your buns: spread a nice layer of Yum Yum sauce on both buns and top with
                a crunchy layer of lettuce
            </li>
            <li>Heat a pan/skillet to 370 degrees Fahrenheit and add a little oil</li>
            <li>
                Put a ball into the pan and smash it as much as you can! Then season that side with
                salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Flip, top with cheese, and let the cheese melt.</li>
            <li>Assemble the burger and you're done!</li>
        </ol>
